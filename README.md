üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to efficiently detect fraudulent credit card transactions, minimizing false positives while maintaining high accuracy.

üéØ Objective
Develop a classification model to predict fraudulent transactions.
Handle data preprocessing effectively, including feature scaling and encoding.
Evaluate the model using performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, and AUC-ROC.
Optimize the model to minimize false positives while maintaining high sensitivity.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview
This repository contains a step-by-step implementation of a fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. The workflow follows a structured pipeline that includes:
Data Exploration: Initial exploration of data, visualization, and identifying key patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
Model Training: Training and optimizing multiple classification models.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using key metrics.
